The data is input as an Excel file with the following requirements:

-   All the data must be contained in a single Excel sheet.
-   The first row of the sheet defines the column names.
-   The next row defines the result of each growth experiment under
    static conditions.
-   The sheet must have a column named `mu` with the maximum growth rate
    (recommended units: log10 CFU/h) observed in the experiment.
-   The sheet can have as many additional columns as wanted, each one
    defining the value of an environmental condition during the
    experiment.
