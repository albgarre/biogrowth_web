Biogrowth
---------

This application serves as an interface to the functions for modelling
microbial growth included in the biogrowth R package from the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN):

> <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=biogrowth" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=biogrowth</a>

The application is divided in modules that can be accessed form the left
panel. It includes the following features:

-   Prediction of microbial growth under static conditions.
-   Stochastic growth prediction under static conditions.
-   Prediction of microbial growth under dynamic conditions considering
    an arbitrary number of environmental factors.
-   Model fitting of primary growth model to data gathered under static
    conditions.
-   One-step fitting of primary and secondary growth models to data
    gathered under dynamic conditions with an arbitrary number of
    environmental factors.
-   Estimation of cardinal parameters from growth rates obtained from
    static experiments under an arbitrary number of environmental
    conditions.
-   Editable, “publication ready” plots of the model predictions and
    model fits.
-   Statistical information of the model fits.
-   Several fitting diagnostics.
-   Several measurements (ME, RMSE, log-likelihood, AIC, BIC, Af and Bf)
    of the predicted/fitted curve with respect to the experimental data.
-   Output of the adjusted curve as a text file.

All the calculations are done according to usual methods in predictive
microbiology. Please check the user manual (also on the left panel) for
additional details.

Please note that the application uses the GitHub version of the
biogrowth package
(<a href="https://github.com/albgarre/biogrowth_web" class="uri">https://github.com/albgarre/biogrowth_web</a>),
which is more updated than the CRAN version. Hence, the calculations may
vary slightly with respect to those of the package.
