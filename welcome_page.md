Biogrowth web is an interface to the functions for modelling microbial
growth included in the biogrowth R package, which is publicly in the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) under the following link:

> not yet

It includes the following features:

-   Prediction of microbial growth under static conditions.
-   Prediction of microbial growth under dynamic conditions considering
    an arbitrary number of environmental factors.
-   Stochastic growth prediction under static conditions.
-   Model fitting of primary growth model to data gathered under static
    conditions.
-   One-step fitting of primary and secondary growth models to data
    gathered under dynamic conditions with an arbitrary number of
    environmental factors.
-   Estimation of cardinal parameters from growth rates obtained from
    static experiments under an arbitrary number of environmental
    conditions.
-   Editable, “publication ready” plots of the model predictions and
    model fits.
-   Statistical information of the model fits.
-   Several fitting diagnostics.
-   Several measurements (ME, RMSE, log-likelihood, AIC, BIC, Af and Bf)
    of the predicted/fitted curve with respect to the experimental data.
-   Output of the adjusted curve as a text file.

Calculations are done according to usual methods in predictive
microbiology. Please check the user manual (on the left) for additional
details.
