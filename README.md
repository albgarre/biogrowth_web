The goal of biogrowth web is to serve as a friendly user interface to
the function included in the biogrowth R package for R. This includes:

-   making predictions under static environmental conditions.
-   making predictions under dynamic environmental conditions.
-   making predictions under static or dynamic conditions considering
    parameter uncertainty.
-   fitting models to data gathered under static environmental
    conditions.
-   fitting models to data gathered under dynamic environmental
    conditions.

Moreover, it provides statistical information of all the fit and several
publication-ready plots of the results.
